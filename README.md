# Elevatelab_Task_5
This task focuses on evaluating a machine learning classification model using standard evaluation metrics after performing a proper train–test split. The goal is to understand model performance on unseen data using the Heart Disease dataset.

# Objectives

Apply train–test split to the dataset

Train a Logistic Regression model

Evaluate the model using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

Interpret results for classification performance

#  Dataset

Name: Heart Disease Dataset

File: heart.csv

Target Column: target

0 → No heart disease

1 → Heart disease present


# Tools & Technologies

Python

Google Colab

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn


#  Methodology

Load the dataset

Separate features and target variable

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%)

Train Logistic Regression model

Predict on test data

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix



# Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model

Precision: Correctness of positive predictions

Recall: Ability to identify actual positive cases

Confusion Matrix: Detailed error analysis


# Results

The model achieved satisfactory accuracy

Precision and recall values indicate effective classification

Confusion matrix shows more correct predictions than errors

Model generalizes well to unseen data


# Key Learnings

Importance of train–test split

Understanding evaluation metrics

Interpreting confusion matrix

Avoiding overfitting through proper evaluation


# Conclusion

Task 5 successfully demonstrates how to evaluate a classification model using standard metrics. Logistic Regression provides reliable performance, making it a suitable baseline model for heart disease prediction.
