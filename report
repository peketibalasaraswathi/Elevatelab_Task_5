1. Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection using machine learning techniques can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

The objective of this task is to understand how well a trained model performs on unseen data using evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.


2. Dataset Description

3. Tools & Technologies Used

Platform: Google Colab

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn


4. Data Preprocessing

Dataset loaded using pandas.read_csv()

Checked structure and data types using info() and head()

No missing values detected

Target variable separated from features


5. Train–Test Split

The dataset was divided into:

80% Training Data

20% Testing Data

Purpose:
- Training set → Used to train the model
- Testing set → Used to evaluate performance on unseen data


A fixed random_state was used to ensure reproducibility of results.

 6. Model Selection

Logistic Regression was chosen because:

It is effective for binary classification

Easy to interpret

Common baseline model for medical datasets

Performs well with structured data


7. Model Training

The Logistic Regression model was trained using the training dataset.
The model learned relationships between patient attributes and the presence of heart disease.


 8. Prediction

Predictions were generated on the test dataset, producing binary outputs:

1 → Heart disease detected

0 → No heart disease detected

 
9. Evaluation Metrics

The following evaluation metrics were used:

 Accuracy

Measures overall correctness of the model

Indicates how many predictions were correct out of total predictions

 Precision

Measures how many predicted positive cases were actually positive

Important when false positives must be minimized

 Recall

Measures how many actual positive cases were correctly identified

Very important in medical diagnosis to avoid missing disease cases

Confusion Matrix

A 2×2 matrix showing:

True Positives

True Negatives

False Positives

False Negatives

This helps in understanding the types of errors made by the model.

10. Results Interpretation

The model achieved good accuracy, indicating reliable overall performance

Precision and recall values were balanced, showing effective disease detection

Confusion matrix showed higher correct predictions compared to incorrect ones

The model generalized well to unseen data, indicating no overfitting


11. Importance of Train–Test Split

Prevents overfitting

Provides unbiased evaluation

Simulates real-world prediction performance

Essential for trustworthy machine learning models


 12. Key Learnings

How to split data properly for evaluation

Importance of different evaluation metrics

Understanding trade-offs between precision and recall

Interpreting confusion matrix for error analysis

Applying machine learning responsibly in healthcare


13. Conclusion

This task successfully demonstrated the evaluation of a machine learning classification model using standard metrics. Logistic Regression provided reliable performance in predicting heart disease, and the evaluation metrics confirmed the model’s effectiveness. Such evaluation techniques are critical before deploying models in real-world medical applications.
